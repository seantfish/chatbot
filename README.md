Some natural language experimentation in Julia

The idea is to start off with a symbolic system that is
retrieval based.
Eventually, it may ship-of-theseus its way into some more advanced
techniques.

I want something that is somewhat sensible and dumb rather than completely
nonsensical and "smart".

Why use Julia? Because it's interesting and fast and I want to try it.
It may not be the most practical option for a symbolic system, given that such
programs can even be bundled in emacs, but I hope to start using Flux later on.
